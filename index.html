Covolutional Neural Network 

Convolution part is for Feature Extraction

Why do we need Feature Extraction?

We need Feature Extraction to save valueable information of the image and still reduce features.

Edge Detection

With the help of E.D. we find out the features

This happens in the Convolve Layer

We us kernels/filters/feature_detectors in convolve layer
